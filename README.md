#Problem Statement
Business Considerations:
A school needs a hand-held device that they can use both for Playing Games. They want a device which contains the below mentioned games: -
1. Rainbow Predictor: Display a Rainbow when conditions are met.
2. Weather Logger: Log Data from the sensors and then display it as a line graph.
3. Tightrope: Tilt your Sense HAT to guide a character along a path.
4. Compass Maze: Use the Sense HAT compass and navigate out of a maze.

Problem1
Countdown Timer
You need to display a countdown starting from 0. The countdown will be displayed on the 8*8 LED Matrix Grid and will stop only when a keyboard interruption occurs.

Problem2 
Rainbow Predictor In this game you will use the temperature and humidity sensors on the Sense HAT to predict when there’s a good chance of spotting a rainbow. When the right conditions are detected you will display a rainbow on the Sense HAT LED Matrix. Hint: Set a condition where you get a rainbow if the temperature is over 20 degrees C and the humidity is over 80 percent. Try experimenting to find the weather conditions for sunshine (yellow) and snow (white)


Problem3
Weather Logger In this game you need to collect data from the Sense HAT’s sensors and log it to a file. Then you will have to display that data as a line graph. Hint: Use the PyGal module to display the data as graph.


Problem4
Tightrope In this game in which you must create a path and a character. You will have to tilt your Sense HAT to guide the character along the path. If you fall off the path, you must start again from the beginning. Hint: Use the Sense HAT gyroscope to guide the Character along the path that you have created.

Problem5
Compass Maze
In this game you will use the Sense HAT as a compass to navigate out of a maze of colourful rooms. You will need to point the Sense HAT in the direction you want to move and then press the button in the middle of the joystick to make a move.
Hint: The Sense HAT contains a magnetometer that can be used to work out which direction is North.
